In this repository, I have included 4 projects that I have created over the last couple of months. Please take a look at the source code for further analysis of my code. 

•	ATM Simulator (Java) – This program prints a menu that will take user transactions (balance, deposit, withdrawal, quit). Each input is recorded until the user quits and then the transaction history is printed to the screen detailing the amounts and balances of each transaction.

•	Chutes And Ladders Game (C) – This program builds a game board in a snake like fashion from 1 to 100. 2 players start at 0 and the first to 100 wins. A die is rolled each turn and added to each player’s score. Switch statements are used to determine each player’s turns. Control flow is utilized to determine if a chute or ladder was landed on. Each player’s progress will be seen on the game board as they move through the game. 

•	Find File Script (Python) – This script will search for a file (ex. file.txt) named by the user in each directory (ex. C:). This script uses recursion to move deeper into each directory that is found and returns the full path of file name if found in that directory. Each path is printed so the user can determine where all the files with the same name are located. Errors due to permission or file not found are logged.

•	Battleship (Python) – 1v1 game using various functions to place ships(lists) within a 2d array. Player 1 places all their ships. Checks are made to see if there is a letter associated with the ship at that index and a hit or miss is called. Game continues until player runs out of turns or all ships are sunk.
